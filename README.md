# QMK OLED Animations

A set of features that can be included in a QMK keymap, the most interesting of which allow for masking and scrolling of bitmaps and wpm dependent OLED animations.

A video example is available here: https://imgur.com/a/totoro-rain-wpm-counter-GhDGVTk

The provided firmware contains many additional animations implemented in keymap and features/bitmap. There are also several other very useful features, particularly dynamic_macro_status and special_tap_dance which can be copied into your own keymaps.
